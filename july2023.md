Implement 'Brewing ideas #1' for all dictionaries.

# Brewing ideas
  1. gra displays use a 'padding-left' technique for indentation of `<div>` elements.  This is done in function sthndl_div of basicdisplay.php module of csl-websanlexion.
  This method is better than prior technique because no text is hidden by right margin.
   This could be applied to other dictionaries.
  3. Relatedly.  The display of  `<div n="X">` is dictionary dependent.  Would it be better to have a collection of
     attributes (values of X) which are implementd the same for all dictionaries.  This should be possible, but
     likely will require some recoding of the dictionaries.
