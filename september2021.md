# Datewise log

## 01 September 2021

## 02 September 2021

1. In the issue https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/414#issuecomment-911742190, Mr. Nagabhushana Rao specifically asked for Cologne data in a manner which is nearer to the printed text, rather than having Devanagari data in SLP1 scheme.
2. The issue was further elaborated in https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-orig/issues/604 .
3. Based on this requirement, development was done and a new repository csl-devanagari was created to cater to this requirement.
4. Two scripts `to_devanagari.py` and `to_slp1.py` were written for allowing to and fro conversion to Devanagari and SLP1.
5. `to_devanagari.py` script converted a given dictionary to Devanagari and stored in csl-devanagari/v02/dictcode/dictcode.txt.
6. `to_devanagari.py` script converted csl-devanagari/v02/dictcode/dictcode.txt to SLP1 and stored in csl-devanagari/slp1/dictcode.txt. Folder slp1 is not tracked via git, because it is supposed to be the same as csl-orig/v02/dictcode/dictcode.txt file.
7. A `redo.sh` script was written which ran both `to_devanagri.py` and `to_slp1.py` script on a given dictionary and stored the differences in csl-devanagari/diff/dictcode.txt.

## 03 September 2021

1. The differences which were found out in csl-devanagari/diff folder for every dictionary were examined, and necessary corrections were made in either the code or the data to weed out such differences.
2. A script `redo_all.sh` was created. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/commit/a09d0236a0e7973b899720d73ddab02d62c2e144#diff-8c5967fd8486f34493710cc39b240aad46536cf4ee421ffd0479e6542db03e36 .
3. Issues https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/1 to https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/30 were raised. Necessary changes were made. Majority of them were regarding wrong conversion from accented IAST to Devanagari. As Mr. Nagabhushana Rao did not want such a conversion, and was happy with IAST data as it is, majority of issues were resolved. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/4#issuecomment-912456604 for details.
4. Some changes were required when there were trailing whitespaces in the meta-line of a few dictionaries. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/9 for example.

1. csl-json - Mr. Neelesh Bodas of https://ashtadhyayi.com/ confirmed that the website uses data directly from csl-json repository. It is realtime. Thus, the downstream users who use https://ashtadhyayi.com/ for searching Sanskrit dictionaries get benefits of latest data from Cologne. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-json/issues/5#issuecomment-914911576 for details.

1. cologne-stardict - Removed dependency of `make_babylon.py` script on `lxml` module. lxml is difficult to install on windows, and is an overkill in the context. The script was modified to use native python xml.etree module.
