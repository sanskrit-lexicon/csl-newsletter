# Brewing ideas

1. COLOGNE. Add new conventions and code to handle them, preferably in v03, at least for MW. This would allow us to experiment and add new features / markups. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/COLOGNE/issues/399
2. MWS. Andhrabharati has always wanted to do corrections of all entries of a given dictionary in one go, instead of making changes based on different themes. We need to help establish some system, which will be able to handle this transition. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/issues/145#issuecomment-1364639704.
3. MWS. Examine possibly missed alternate headwords. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/issues/145#issuecomment-1374555732.
4. MWS. Andhrabharati started small steps towards full review of MW. We need to smoothen out the differences of opinion. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MWS/issues/146.
