# Brewing ideas

1. BEN. Try to understand @Andhrabharati's version of BEN. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/BEN/issues/5 and https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-devanagari/issues/32#issuecomment-932799897.
2. csl-lnum. Use csl-lnum repository for giving users the opportunity to correct any given entry from Cologne website. Basic / advanced or any other view. See https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/COLOGNE/issues/375.
3. funderburkjim/boesp-prep. Thomas continues to proof-read BOESP ansii files.
4. funderburkjim/boesp-prep-sam. Sampada continues to proof-read BOESP in SLP1 transliteration.
5. funderburkjim/boesp-prep-ab. Andhrabharati seems to have already completed his proof-reading of BOESP, but has not posted the file yet. Maybe it would be put to optimum use once Thomas and Sampada also complete their proof reading.
6. csl-lnum. Is it necessary to match the digitized texts to printed texts? https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-lnum/issues/2.
